If you are forking it, then you'll also want to [set an `upstream` repo](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-forks-and-upstreams ) to keep your fork up to date.*

## How to run the tests.
The source code for tests is located in `aiqc/aiqc/tests/__init__.py`. The `run_jobs()` is called manually because we often need to inspect the `Queue` object.

Once we are confident that our schema handles all data types and analysis types, we will invest more rigorous testing.
```python
import aiqc
from aiqc import tests

q1 = tests.make_test_queue('keras_binary')
q1.run_jobs()

q2 = tests.make_test_queue('keras_multiclass')
q2.run_jobs()

q3 = tests.make_test_queue('keras_regression')
q3.run_jobs()

q4 = tests.make_test_queue('keras_text_binary')
q4.run_jobs()

q5 = tests.make_test_queue('keras_image_binary')
q5.run_jobs()

q6 = tests.make_test_queue('keras_sequence_binary')
q6.run_jobs()

q7 = tests.make_test_queue('keras_tabular_forecast')
q7.run_jobs()

q8 = tests.make_test_queue('keras_image_forecast')
q8.run_jobs()

q9 = tests.make_test_queue('pytorch_binary')
q9.run_jobs()

q10 = tests.make_test_queue('pytorch_multiclass')
q10.run_jobs()

q11 = tests.make_test_queue('pytorch_regression')
q11.run_jobs()

q12 = tests.make_test_queue('pytorch_image_binary')
q12.run_jobs()
```
