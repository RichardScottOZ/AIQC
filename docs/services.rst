Phase I - Consultation
======================

.. raw:: html

  <div class="svcBox">
    <div class="svcHeader">
      1. &nbsp;Define the problem to solve.
    </div>
    <div class="svcDescribe">
      Interview stakeholders to understand the root of the problem, its impact on the success metrics of the organization, and the context in which that problem occurs. It is critical to have a thorough understanding of the problem area when deciding what information to feed into an algorithm during training.
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="svcBox">
    <div class="svcHeader">
      2. &nbsp;Qualify the data source.
    </div>
    <div class="svcDescribe">
      What data does the organization have that will help us solve this problem? An algorithm is only as good as the data that you feed it. This applies to not only the quality of the data (availability, uniformity, sparsity) but also how relevant that data is to the problem at hand. Is the data in a workable format or will customer-specific pipelines need to be developed?
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="svcBox">
    <div class="svcHeader">
      3. &nbsp;Checkpoint to review the project plan.
    </div>
    <div class="svcDescribe">
      The AIQC team will collaborate with your team to make a project plan that details the implementation phase. For example, who will be granted access to the data, when will the data gathering be finished, and in what computing environment will the analysis take place? Ensure that all parties involved are in alignment about the scope of the Statement of Work (SOW) before proceeding.
    </div>
  </div>

Phase II - Implementation
=========================

.. raw:: html

  <div class="svcBox">
    <div class="svcHeader">
      4. &nbsp;Prepare the computing environment.
    </div>
    <div class="svcDescribe">
      Install the AIQC Python software package and its dependencies. Setup the customers' AIQC database. Verify that there are sufficient computing resources (memory, processors, disk storage) for the problem at hand.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="svcBox">
    <div class="svcHeader">
      5. &nbsp;Prepare the dataset.
    </div>
    <div class="svcDescribe">
      Register the dataset with the customer's AIQC database. Identify the most informative features (data points) to proceed with; prune out redundancy and validate features with domain experts. Determine the best encoder for each feature based on its distribution.
    </div>
  </div>

  
  <div class="svcBox">
    <div class="svcHeader">
      6. &nbsp;Train predictive algorithm.
    </div>
    <div class="svcDescribe">
      Design neural network architectures to receive and tease apart the data into actionable information. Tune the topology and hyperparameters during training experiments. Evaluate models to determine which one will provide the best tradeoff between accuracy and real-world generalizability. Produce a tangible report of metrics and charts that document the performance of the model.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="svcBox">
    <div class="svcHeader">
      7. &nbsp;Demonstration & training.
    </div>
    <div class="svcDescribe">
      A live demo to showcase the performance of the model to stakeholders by making predictions on data that the algorithm has not seen yet. Train the customer employees that will be responsible for running the model going forward.
    </div>
  </div>

  
  <div class="svcBox">
    <div class="svcHeader">
      8. &nbsp;Deploy the algorithm.
    </div>
    <div class="svcDescribe">
      What computing environment will be used to make predictions using the algorithm going forward? Will the model be ran manually; ad hoc by a member of the customers team or would the customer prefer to have AIQC run predictions in batches? Alternatively, would the customer prefer to run the model using a web-service fronted by an API and/or a webapp?
    </div>
  </div>

Phase III - Monitoring
======================

.. raw:: html

  <div class="svcBox">
    <div class="svcHeader">
      9. &nbsp;Maintain algorithm performance.
    </div>
    <div class="svcDescribe">
      As the world changes, will your algorithm be generalizable enough to handle those changes or will the performance of the model start to drift? Is the model slightly biased or mishandling specific scenarios? It is possible that it will need to be retrained before it starts impacting business metrics, but we won't know if we fail to monitor it.
