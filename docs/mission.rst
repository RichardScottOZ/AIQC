*Why Does AIQC Exist?*

----

Over the past 4 years, I worked with the top 5 pharmaceutical companies to analyze national biobanks (UK Biobank and Genomics Medicine Ireland) for DNA-based drivers of complex diseases. In the face of such challenging problems, I was blown away that big pharma's primary form of analysis was the basic statistical test known as an association study, which dates back to the `Victorian era <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Galton#Correlation_and_regression>`__. I kept expecting someone to say, "Okay, now is the time for us to start using deep learning," but it never happened. If the researchers at the most well-financed organizations in the world weren't equipped to take advantage of AI, then how would this ever be possible for non-profit scientists?

Deep learning has the power to accelerate the rate of scientific discovery by acting as a torch that reveals the laws of nature through data-driven pattern recognition. When it comes to reversing climate catastrophe, humanity is at a point where it needs to make major scientific advances over a short period of time. Let's empower our smartest people with the best analytical tools we have so that we can survive.

1. Accelerate science by making deep learning accessible.
=========================================================
  
  * Reduce the amount of programming and data science know-how required to perform deep learning. This unattainable skillset trifecta causes machine learning to be underutilized in science. What would Newton & Einstein have discovered with the power of deep learning?
  * Provide field-specific deep learning solutions for research in the form of: pipelines for preprocessing scientific file formats, pre-trained models for transfer learning, and visualizations of predictions. 

|

2. Bring the scientific method to data science.
===============================================

  * Make machine learning less of a black box by implementing a "Quality control (QC)" protocols comprised of best practice validation rules.
  * Reproducibly record not only the machine learning experiments, but also the lineage for preparing data. This is important for combatting bias during the data gathering and evaluation phases.
  * This toolset provides research teams a standardized method for ML-based evidence, as opposed to each research team cobbling together their own approach. An AIQC file should be submitted alongside publications and model zoo entries as a proof.

|

3. Break down walled gardens to keep science open.
==================================================

  * The majority of research doesn't happen in the cloud, it's performed on the personal computers of individuals. We empower the non-cloud researchers: the academic/ institute HPCers, the remote server SSH'ers, and everyday laptop warriors.
  * If the entire scientific community does not have access to the toolset used to conduct the experiment, then it is not reproducible.
