Why Does AIQC Exist?
********************

Deep learning has the power to accelerate scientific discoveries by acting as a torch that reveals the laws of nature through data-driven pattern recognition.

Earth's natural resources are being destroyed, and it's beyond our current capabilities to repair the environment. In order to survive here and elsewhere, we need to make major advances in non-linear fields such as synthetic biology (to heal the earth) and small-scale nuclear power (to fuel its progress). We can't physically transport 10 billion people off of this planet.

1. Accelerate science by making deep learning accessible.
=========================================================
  
  * Reduce the amount of programming and data science know-how required to perform deep learning. This unattainable skillset trifecta causes machine learning to be underutilized in science. What would Newton & Einstein have discovered with the power of deep learning?
  * Provide field-specific deep learning solutions for research in the form of: pipelines for preprocessing scientific file formats, pre-trained models for transfer learning, and visualizations of predictions. 
  

2. Bring the scientific method to data science.
===============================================

  * Make machine learning less of a black box by implementing a "Quality control (QC)" protocols comprised of best practice validation rules.
  * Reproducibly record not only the machine learning experiments, but also the lineage for preparing data. This is important for combatting bias during the data gathering and evaluation phases.
  * This toolset provides research teams a standardized method for ML-based evidence, rather than each researcher spending time cobbling together their own approach. An AIQC file should be submitted alongside publications and model zoo entries as a proof.


3. Break down walled gardens to keep science open.
==================================================

  * The majority of research doesn't happen in the cloud, it's performed on the personal computers of individuals. We empower the non-cloud researchers: the academic/ institute HPCers, the remote server SSH'ers, and everyday desktop warriors.
  * If the entire scientific community does not have access to the toolset used to conduct the experiment, then, again, it is not reproducible.
