  <p class="explain">
    Most of us are all too familiar with the concept of a spreadsheet; where each row represents a record, and each column provides information that describes about that record. Let us then, examine the two major types of AI analysis in the context of a spreadsheet:
  </p>


.. list-table::
  :widths: 15, 85
  :align: center

  * - **Generative**
    - Given what we know about rows 1:1000 ‚Üí generate row 1001.

  * - **Discriminative**
    - Given what we know about columns A:F ‚Üí determine the values of column G.

  <p class="explain">
    <i>Discriminative</i> analysis is highly practical because it can help us answer two important questions:
  </p>


.. list-table::
  :widths: 15, 85
  :align: center
  
  * - **Categorize**
    - What is it - benign vs malignant? landmine vs rock? approve vs deny? fake vs real?

  * - **Quantify**
    - How much - price? distance? volume? age? radioactivity? gene expression?

    As an example, let's pretend we work at a zoo and have a spreadsheet about animals üê¢ We want to use supervised learning in order to predict the species of a given animal.
  </p>


.. list-table::
  :widths: 20, 80
  :align: center
  
  * - **Features**
    - informative columns like `num_legs`, `color`, `has_shell`.

  * - **Label**
    - the `species` column that we want to predict.

  <p class="explain">
    We learn about the <i>features</i> in order to predict the <i>label</i>.
  </p>

.. raw:: html

  <p class="explain">
    In order to automate this process üîå we need build an equation that predicts our <i>label</i> when we show it set of <i>features</i>. We call this equation an <i>algorithm</i>. Here is our simplified example:
  </p>
  
|

.. code-block:: python

  species = (num_legs * x) + (color * y) + (has_shell * z)

|

.. raw:: html

  <p class="explain">
    The tricky part is that we need to figure out the values (aka <i>weights</i>) for the <i>parameters</i> (x, y, z) that will return the correct label no matter what features we show it ‚öñÔ∏è To do this manually, we could simply use trial-and-error; make a change to <i>x</i> and see if that improves the <i>accuracy</i> of the model until we have something that performs reasonably well.

  <p class="explain">
    This is where the magic of AI comes into play üîÆ It simply automates that trial-and-error ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø. Computers can rapidly compute and keep track of thousands of parameters at once.

  <p class="explain">
    During each <i>batch</i>, the algorithm looks at a few rows at a time, attempts to make predictions about them, checks how off the mark those predictions are, and updates its <i>weights</i> to try to minimize any errors. It tracks how changes in each weight impact the performance of the model.

    There are different types of algorithms for working with different types of data:
  </p>


.. list-table::
  :widths: 20, 40
  :align: center
  
  * - **Linear**
    - tabular data like spreadsheets.

  * - **Convolve**
    - images and video üì∏.

  * - **Recur**
    - time series data ‚è±Ô∏è.

    They can be mixed and matched to handle almost any real-life scenario.

    Data scientists oversee the training of an algorithm much like a chefs cooks a supper üéõÔ∏è The heat is what actually cooks the food, but there's still a few things that the chef controls (aka <i>tunes</i>): 


.. list-table::
  :widths: 20, 80
  :align: center
  
  * - **Architecture**
    - If the food doesn't fit in the pan, switch to a larger pan with deeper/ taller "layers."

  * - **Hyperparameters**
    - If it's cooking too fast, then turn down knobs like the "learning rate."

    And that's really all there is to it üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The rest is just figuring out how to feed your data into/ out of the algorithms, which is where <a href='index.html'>AIQC</a> comes into play.
