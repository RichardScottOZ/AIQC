  <p class="explain">
    If you are generally familiar with spreadsheets then you are already half way to understanding AI. For the purpose of this discussion, let's assume that each <i>row</i> in a spreadsheet represents a record, and each <i>column</i> provides information about that record. Bearing this in mind, there are two major types of AI:
  </p>


.. list-table::
  :widths: 15, 85
  :align: center

  * - **Generative**
    - Given what we know about rows 1:1000 ‚Üí generate row 1001.

  * - **Discriminative**
    - Given what we know about columns A:F ‚Üí determine the values of column G.

  <p class="explain">
    <i>Discriminative</i> analysis is highly practical because it can help us answer two important questions:
  </p>


.. list-table::
  :widths: 15, 85
  :align: center
  
  * - **Categorize**
    - What is it - benign vs malignant? landmine vs rock? approve vs deny? fake vs real?

  * - **Quantify**
    - How much - price? distance? volume? age? radioactivity? gene expression?

    As an example, let's pretend we work at a zoo where we have a spreadsheet that contains information about the traits of different animals üê¢ We want to use <i>discriminative learning</i> in order to <i>categorize</i> the species of a given animal.
  </p>


.. list-table::
  :widths: 20, 80
  :align: center
  
  * - **Features**
    - Informative columns like `num_legs`, `has_wings`, `has_shell`.

  * - **Label**
    - The `species` column that we want to predict.

    We learn about the <i>features</i> in order to predict the <i>label</i>.
  </p>

.. raw:: html

  <p class="explain">
    To automate this process üîå we need an equation (aka <i>algorithm</i> or <i>model</i>) that predicts our <i>label</i> when we show it a set of <i>features</i>. Here is our simplified example:
  </p>
  
|

.. code-block:: python

  species = (num_legs * x) + (has_wings * y) + (has_shell * z)

|

.. raw:: html

  <p class="explain">
    The challenging part is that we need to figure out the right values (aka <i>weights</i>) for the <i>parameters</i> (x, y, z) so that our algorithm makes accurate predictions ‚öñÔ∏è To do this by hand, we would simply use trial-and-error; make a change to the value of <i>x</i>, and then determine if that change either improved the model or made it worse.

    Fortunately, computers can rapidly perform these repetetitive calculations on our behalf. This is where the magic of AI comes into play üîÆ It simply automates that trial-and-error.

  <p class="figCaption" style="text-align: left;">
    The figure above demonstrates what happens during a training <i>batch</i>: (1) the algorithm looks at a few rows, (2) makes predictions about those rows using its existing weights, (3) checks how accurate those predictions are, (4) adjusts its weights in an attempt to minimize future errors. It's like finding the bottom of a valley by rolling a ball down it.

    There are different types of algorithms for working with different types of data:
  </p>


.. list-table::
  :widths: 20, 40
  :align: center
  
  * - **Linear**
    - Tabular data like spreadsheets.

  * - **Convolutional**
    - Images and video üì∏.

  * - **Recurrent**
    - Time series data ‚è±Ô∏è.

    A data scientist oversees the training of an algorithm much like a chef cooks a meal üéõÔ∏è The heat is what actually cooks the food, but there are still a few things that the chef controls: 


.. list-table::
  :widths: 20, 80
  :align: center
  
  * - **Architecture**
    - If the food doesn't fit in the pan, switch to a larger pan with deeper/ taller *layers*.

  * - **Hyperparameters**
    - If it's cooking too fast, then turn down knobs like the *learning rate*.
